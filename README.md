# MarsFarming


Martian Agriculture Simulator

Multiscale genetics + plant growth + robots + climate simulation

This is a simulation game.

The player provides inputs to various simulated robot controllers.

## Multiscale
The multiscale aspect of the simulation is defined using multiple hierarchical simulations.

The outputs of one simulation provide both parameters and physical inputs to the others.

The connection between simulations is in both directions.

## Use
Run `python main.py` to play.
